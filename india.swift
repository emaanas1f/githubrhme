Initiatives like the Right to Education Act and Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao have improved access to education for girls. Legal reforms such as the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act grant women equal inheritance rights. Employment laws aim to reduce wage disparities, though workplace discrimination persists. Reproductive rights have advanced with the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, yet access to services remains uneven. Despite laws protecting against domestic violence and sexual assault, enforcement challenges and cultural attitudes continue to hinder progress. Ongoing advocacy and reform are crucial to achieving true gender equality in India.")
